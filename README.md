This game was coded as I was learning the PyGame module for Python. It was coded using Python 3.11 and Microsoft Visual Studio Code. I used this lengthy 3-hour tutorial video as a means to learn how to code this game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk&pp=ygUGcHlnYW1l (The Ulitmate Introduction to PyGame by Clear Code)

The code is pretty much identical to the code developed in the tutorial video. However, I added one additional feature to the code that was not covered in the tutorial.

Basically, if you followed the instructions, you would notice that if the game is not active, there is no other way to exit the game except by clicking the close button on the window, or pressing Alt+F4. While this will be the case while the game is active, I made sure to code it where if the game is not active, simply pressing the Escape (ESC) key will exit the game. This is an essential feature in the code that makes it easier to close the window without clicking the X button on the window or pressing shortcut keys to exit.

# Game Instructions
It's a really simple game. All you do is jump to avoid the snails, or not jump to avoid the flies.
